## What is Fruity Stereo Shaper?
 
Fruity Stereo Shaper is a plugin that comes with FL Studio, one of the most popular digital audio workstations (DAWs) for music production. It is part of the Fruity Effects suite, which includes other plugins such as Fruity Reverb, Fruity Delay, Fruity Compressor, and more.
 
Fruity Stereo Shaper works by splitting the input signal into four bands: low, mid-low, mid-high, and high. You can then adjust the stereo parameters for each band separately or together. You can also use the LFO (low-frequency oscillator) and envelope sections to modulate the stereo image over time.

## How to Use Fruity Stereo Shaper?
 
To use Fruity Stereo Shaper, you need to insert it as an effect on the mixer track that you want to process. You can do this by clicking on the slot below the track name and selecting Fruity Stereo Shaper from the list of effects.

Once you have inserted Fruity Stereo Shaper, you will see its interface with several knobs and buttons. Here are the main controls that you need to know:
 
- **Mix**: This knob controls the dry/wet mix of the effect. You can use it to blend the original signal with the processed signal. A value of 0% means no effect, while a value of 100% means full effect.
- **Phase Offset**: This knob controls the phase difference between the left and right channels. You can use it to create phase cancellation or enhancement effects. A value of 0Â° means no phase offset, while a value of 180Â° means maximum phase offset.
- **Pan**: This knob controls the panning of the signal. You can use it to move the signal left or right in the stereo field. A value of -100% means full left, while a value of 100% means full right.
- **Width**: This knob controls the width of the stereo field. You can use it to widen or narrow the stereo image. A value of 0% means mono, while a value of 200% means double width.
- **Balance**: This knob controls the balance between the left and right channels. You can use it to adjust the volume level of each channel. A value of -100% means full left, while a value of 100% means full right.
- **Bands**: These buttons allow you to select which frequency band you want to edit. You can choose from low, mid-low, mid-high, and high bands. You can also click on the "All" button to edit all bands at once.
- **LFO**: This section allows you to modulate the stereo parameters using a low-frequency oscillator. You can choose from different waveforms such as sine, triangle, sawtooth, square, and random. You can also adjust the speed, depth, phase, and offset of the modulation.
- **Envelope**: This section allows you to modulate the stereo parameters using an envelope follower. You can adjust the attack, decay, sustain, and release of the envelope. You can also choose whether to trigger the envelope by input level or sidechain input.

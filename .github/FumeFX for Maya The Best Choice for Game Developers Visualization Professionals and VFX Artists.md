To use FumeFX for Maya, you need to understand its basic workflow and components. Here are some of the main elements of FumeFX:

- The FumeFX user interface is integrated within Maya's attribute editor and combines all the major fluid simulation components in one place. It allows you to change parameters during the simulation with instant feedback within the GPU accelerated Maya Viewport 2.0.
- The FumeFX solver is the core of the plugin that calculates the fluid dynamics based on your settings and inputs. It supports a wide range of irregular objects for simulation without instabilities. It also features conservative advection, multithreaded lossy compression and GPU acceleration for faster simulations.
- The FumeFX sources are objects that emit fluid into the simulation domain. They can be geometry objects, particles, fields or textures. You can control various attributes of the sources such as type, shape, size, velocity, temperature, density and color.
- The FumeFX grid is a 3D container that defines the boundaries of the simulation domain. It also determines the resolution and quality of the simulation. You can adjust the size, position and orientation of the grid as well as its sub-grid details.
- The FumeFX render is a module that renders the simulated fluid using various shading models and options. It supports multiple scattering, illumination maps, motion blur, depth of field and more. You can also export the simulation data as .fxd files or OpenVDB files for rendering with other renderers.

To create a simple fire effect with FumeFX for Maya, follow these steps:

1. Create a sphere object in your scene and scale it down to a small size. This will be your fire source.
2. Create a FumeFX grid object 8cf37b1e13
